      <h2>Types of Virtual Organs</h2>
      <p class="lead">Virtual organs span across multiple systems in the body, each addressing different challenges in healthcare and research. The five most widely developed examples are the heart, liver, kidney, lungs, and brain. Together, they form the foundation for future whole-body digital twins.

        <h3>Heart</h3>
        <p class="meta">The virtual heart is one of the oldest and most sophisticated organ models. It mimics the electrical activity that initiates heart rhythms and the mechanical forces that circulate blood. Models are employed to investigate arrhythmias, to design pacemakers and defibrillators, and to plan catheter ablation procedures. By developing models of individual patients' hearts, physicians can anticipate how a patient will react to treatment before going into the operating room. Virtual hearts are also at the heart of precision cardiology, in which digital twins are being created to enhance diagnosis and treatment planning</p>

        <h3>Liver</h3>
        <p class="meta">The virtual liver is now the foundation for pharmacology and toxicology. Subramanian (2020) outlines a digital twin of the liver that combines metabolic pathways, bile acid flow, and mitochondrial function. The model correctly forecasted the progression of genetic disease or drug-induced liver injury, and was even tested against clinical evidence. Such methods offer a platform for creating drugs more effectively and safely.</p>

        <h3>Kidney</h3>
        <p class="meta">The kidney plays a critical role in waste filtration and electrolyte regulation, and its malfunction lies at the root of diseases such as chronic kidney disease. Virtual kidneys have also been created to make optimal dialysis therapy and to predict the effect of drugs on renal clearance. Large-scale efforts like the Virtual Kidney Project integrate distributed computing and intricate modeling to extract kidney physiology at cellular, tissue, and organ scales. Such models present the potential to enhance personalized care in nephrology.</p>

        <h3>Lung</h3>
        <p class="meta">The lungs, with their delicate branching airways and gas-exchange units, are also an area of virtual organ modeling. Virtual lungs are employed to examine diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Virtual lungs also have the utility of maximizing mechanical ventilation strategies where clinicians can simulate the effects of varying airflow or pressure settings on patient outcomes. These simulations came into focus particularly with the COVID-19 pandemic, where remote testing was used to optimize respiratory support systems. </p>

        <h3>Brain</h3>
        <p class="meta">Virtual brain provides facilities to simulate neural networks and disorders like epilepsy. Simulations such as the Virtual Epileptic Patient utilize brain scans and network modeling to mimic the propagation of seizures, assisting surgeons in determining how to proceed with the operation. The same techniques are being used to investigate neurodegenerative diseases and brain stimulationÂ treatments.</p>
